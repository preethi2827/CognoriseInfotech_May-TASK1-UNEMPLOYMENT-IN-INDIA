# Unemployment in India: Data Analysis Project

This repository contains the code and data for analyzing the unemployment rate in India, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The project aims to explore trends, patterns, and factors influencing unemployment using data science techniques.

## Dataset Description

The dataset provided by Cognorise Infotech contains the following columns:

- **Region**: The geographical region in India.
- **Date**: The date of observation.
- **Frequency**: The frequency of data collection (e.g., monthly, quarterly).
- **Unemployment Rate (%)**: The percentage of people who are unemployed in the total labor force.
- **Estimated Employed**: The estimated number of employed individuals.
- **Estimated Labour Participation Rate (%)**: The percentage of the population participating in the labor force.
- **Area**: Specific area or locality within the region.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Extraction**: Utilized Jupyter notebooks to extract and preprocess the dataset for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted EDA to understand the distribution and trends in unemployment rates across different regions and time periods.
3. **Impact of COVID-19**: Investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on unemployment rates in India.
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Performed statistical tests and regression analysis to identify significant factors influencing unemployment.
5. **Machine Learning Models (Optional)**: Explored predictive modeling techniques to forecast future unemployment rates based on historical data.

## Usage

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: The analysis code is provided in Jupyter notebooks for transparency and reproducibility.
- **Data**: The dataset is included in CSV format (`unemployment_data.csv`) for easy access.
- **Documentation**: Additional documentation, such as methodology and findings, can be found in the `docs` folder.
